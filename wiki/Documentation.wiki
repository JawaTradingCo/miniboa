= Introduction =

Miniboa is a couple files of Python code that provide a bare-bones Telnet server to use as the base for MUD or similar interactive server.  Miniboa has a couple of nice features for this type of application.

  * Asynchronous - no waiting on player input or state. 
  * An external game loop - you decide when to poll for data.   
  * Single threaded - simplifies game design and provides excellent speed.

= Telnet Server =

Creating a Telnet Server is pretty simple.  In fact, you can run with the following three lines of code:

{{{
from miniboa.async import TelnetServer
server = TelnetServer()
while True: server.poll()
}}}

This will launch a server listening on the default port, 7777, that accepts Telnet connections and sends a simple greeting;
{{{
$ telnet localhost 7777
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Greetings from Miniboa!  Now it's time to add your code.
}}}
